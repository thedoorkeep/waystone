          <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Dungeons & Dragons (abbreviated as D&D or DnD) is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game (RPG) originally designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson, and first published in 1974 by Tactical Studies Rules, Inc.

It was derived from miniature wargames with a variation of the Chainmail game serving as the initial rule system. D&D’​s publication is commonly recognized as the beginning of modern role-playing games and the role-playing game industry.
